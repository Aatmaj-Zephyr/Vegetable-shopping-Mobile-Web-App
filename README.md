#  Vegetable Shopping website PWA

This is a application for helping people order vegetables from the local vendors.

## What are we building.....?

In India, there are many housewifes. They buy groceries from local vendors. They usually call or whatsapp order list to the local vegetable and groceries who then deliver them to their houses. Making a list is a tedious task for the housewives. They have so many things to worry about! They have to keep everyone happy at the same time ensuring the right diet for the family. They want to buy the correct quantity of vegetables. Not too many, not too less. That too at the right price. For that sometimes they have to order from 3-4 different vendors!  Can we make the  lives simpler?

What if we put on a nice User Interface to this process? So the only things they have to do is to select the vegetables, groceries and milk products from a user friendly mobile web app. Then the app sends the list to the vendors via whatsapp or gmail. So literally we are making a **house friendly**, efficiant e commerce website. The only thing that we must worry about is the UI must be so simple that anyone must be able to use it! Ulike popular e-commerce websites that we use, this one must be free of al clutter and flashy promotions!
